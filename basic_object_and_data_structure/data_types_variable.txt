data types:
 data types are type of the data that we are handling with
 int- integer (3,20,33)
 float- floating(2.0, 0.5, 100.0)
 str- string("ABDC",'ADSD'"@@@#") string are the ordered sequences of the characters, and they are immutable

data structures:
 data structures are the sequences of the various data types

 list- Ordered sequences of the data types [data1,data2,data3], they are the called as ordered coz they can be acessed 
 by their indexs
 [1,'Hi',[23.4,"Secondary list"],200.3]
 Note: In python the index starts with 0
 
 dict- The datas are mapped with the key {k1:v1,k2:v2,k3:v3}
 {"mykey":"value"}

 tuple - Ordered unmutable means unchangable once declared them (1,"Hi",200.3), similar to list

 sets- Unorderd collections of unique elements {"a","b"}

 Boolean - Logical value indicating True or False

Variable assigment:

 Python support dynamic programming meaning we can directly assign a value to variable without declaring them
 as int, float or str or ch as we defined in other languages.

 variables are like the container which holds the value in them

 single variable assignment
 a=50 
 a="string"
 a=100.4
 
 assiging same value to multiple variables
 a=b=c=50

 assiging different values to the multiple variables

 a,b,c = 50,"string","112.4

Numbers:

 int is short form of integer like whole numbers
 float is short form of floating number like 12.4,100.0 decimal point
 
 whenever we are working with the number we should be careful about the ordering of the execution
 () > ** > +x,-x.~x > *,/,// > +,- > <<,>> > & > ^ > | > ==, != , >, >=, <, <=, is, is not, in, not in > not > and>or
