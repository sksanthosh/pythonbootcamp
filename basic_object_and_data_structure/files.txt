Files can be audio file,text file or csv file 

we can write, read or append to a file, when we open the file we have to make sure we are closing that file, for next 
operations on it.

Two ways to deal with the file
myfile=open("myfile.txt") by default the mode will be r, we have to change it to w for writing
r - read
w - overwrites
a - append
r+ - read+ write
w+ - read + write overwrites
if we open like above then we need to close the file myfile.close()

when we have opened file in read mode only then we should use only read functions and not the writes similarly vice versa

to avoid the necessary of the closing of the file we use below method

with open("myfile.txt",mode='w') as fileobject:
  fileobject.read() or fileobject.write()

with open("myfile.txt",mode="w+") as myfile:
    myfile.writelines(["\nthis is first line","\nthis is second line","\nthis is third line"])
    myfile.seek(0)
    print(myfile.read())
    
this is first line
this is second line
this is third line

with open("myfile.txt",mode="w+") as myfile:
    myfile.writelines(["\nthis is first line","\nthis is second line","\nthis is third line"])
    myfile.seek(0)
    print(myfile.readlines())
    
['\n', 'this is first line\n', 'this is second line\n', 'this is third line']
