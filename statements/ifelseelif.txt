If,ELSE and ELIF are used to execute the certain code block if the conditon are meet.

example: 

if condition = True:
   Code block under if
else:
   Code block under else

Notice in above example when the condition is True, the code block under if is executed else
the code block under else is executed

If we want to check for multiple conditions and execute the code under them then

if condition = True:
   Code block under if
elif condition = True:
   Code block under elif block
elif condition = True:
   Code block under elif block
else:
   Code block under else
