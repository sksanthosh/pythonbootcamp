While loops are used to execute an set of code block untill the condition becomes false
in other words execute the codeblock untill the condition is true

Syntax:

All the variables in the while loop should be intialize before using them

Intializing variable 

While(Condition == True):
  Code block under while loop
  expression or operation to make the Condition False else it will be a infinite loop

ex: 
x=0
 while x<=5:
   print(x)
   x+=1

we can also use else under the while loops
hungry = True
while hungry:
 print("feed my cats")
 cat_says = input("Does your cat is hungry Y/N : ")
 if cat_says.lower() == "y":
   hungry = True
 else cat_says.lower() == "n":
   hungry = False

there are 3 things that are used to do some action during the loops

break, continue and pass
example:

s="Sammy"

for i in s:
    if i =="a":
        pass
    print(i)

S
a
m
m
y

for i in s:
    if i =="a":
        continue
    print(i)
    
S
m
m
y

for i in s:
    if i =="a":
        break
    print(i)
    
S
