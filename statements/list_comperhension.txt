List Comprehension are used whenever you are appending an value to the list after performing some operation with the
iteratable 

example
lst=[]
s="Hai God!"
for l in s:
  lst.append(l)

LC: lst=[l for l in s]

mylst=[]
for i in range(0,10):
  mylst.append(i*3) or mylst.append(i*i)

LC: mylst=[i*3 or i*i for i in range(0,10)]

Note: It is always recommend to write the above examples with normal type than list comprehension as it will help in clean code
and readaibilty

mylst=[]
for x in range(1,4):
   for y in range(20,40):
      mylst.append(x*y)

mylst=[x*y for x in range(1,4) for y in range(20,40)]
