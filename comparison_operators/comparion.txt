Comparision are having > < >= <= != == also we can use and, or and not.

2>4<5
this is equivalent to and 2>4 and 4<5
this will be true only when the left and right output are true else it will be false

2>4 or 4<5: this will be true when either left or right side are true, and false if both the side are false

not is used to reverse the bool output, if it is true it will be false  and viceversa
