Oops concept is built on the keyword object, the object is a reference that is created to the class
and One can access any parameter, attributes and methods that are defined in the object using that object.

The Oops begins with the keyword class and ClassName are definde in the Camelcase format

class ClassName(object any class ultimated inherit all the functions, params from the object class.)
#Object class is like god father of all the classes in py3 we don't need to define the object.
class ClassName():
  class_object_attributes = "value" # this is a class object attributes which does't need any assignment

  def __init__(self,parameters):
    self.parameters=parameters # this is known as instance attributes, coz the assignment to these attributes happen at the 
    time of the instance / object creation to this class.

  def methods(self):
   pass
    
  Methods are the functions that are defined the class, here also the methods follows LEGB rule for variable look out.

  self represents the same memory location as of object, in other words when the object is created the value of object is
  assigned to self, so we can access any attributes,methods that touches this self.
  Like below
  def methods(self): # here this methods is touched to self for accessing later
  and after self.parameters is defined we should use self.paramters in the entire class.
