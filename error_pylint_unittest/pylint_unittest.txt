pylint is a python packages which uses pep8 standard we can use this package to check our script is according to the pep8
standard python ideal score is 10, sometime it is good to not put for 10 as we also want our script to be understandable

we can install by pip command: pip install pylint

unittest: is a builtin package that can be used to test our code.

to start with the unittest we need to import the unitest module first

myscript.py

def func(text):
  """
  Input takes string as an input
  Output gives the first character as Caps for the given string
  """
  try:
     if " " in text:
        return text.title()
     else:
        return text.captialize
  except:
       print("There is problem with the user input, please check again")
main.py
import unittest
import myscript

class MainScript(unittest.TestCase):
      def func(self):
      """
      Input: takes an input from the user
      Output: calles a func from myscript
      """
      text = input("Enter the input to conver the result to capatilize")
      result = myscript.func(text)
      self.assertEqual(result,"Monthy Python")
      
if __name__=="__main__":
     unittest.main()
